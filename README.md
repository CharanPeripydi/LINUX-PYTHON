# File Organizer: Python and Shell Script Solution

## Description
This project organizes files in a directory by their file extensions using a Python script (`org_files.py`). Additionally, a shell script (`commands.sh`) is provided to automate the creation of test files and running the Python script.

## How It Works
1. The Python script (`org_files.py`) identifies all files in the directory.
2. Files are grouped into folders based on their extensions (e.g., `.txt`, `.jpg`, `.py`).
3. If a folder for a file type does not exist, it is created automatically.
4. Files are then moved into their respective folders.
